Lab Assignment 2: Find Primes using Threads.

To Build:
	$ make

	Unfortunately I do not know how to compile the java PrimeTester.java.
To Run:
	$ ./PrimeThreads <N> <M>

Purpose:

	This program takes two integers, the first being the max of a range between 1 and itself, and the second beingthe number of threads desired to be run by the program. The former value is known as N, while the latter is called M.

Thus the program seperated the range into intervals of length (N/M) where M < N. It will then print the primes found, and the respective threads that found them, to the terminal.
